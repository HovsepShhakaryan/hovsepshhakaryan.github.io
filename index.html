    <h1>NaviGoX</h1>
    <p>When a user creates an account, it is created only on his phone on the personal memory of the phone, and when the application is deleted from the phone, then all data is deleted in the place with the application.</p>
    <p>No one can have access to the crawler is data from outside. An account needs to be created so that the user can create several account records using one phone. When the crawler deletes his application, all accounts and category data associated with these accounts will be extended.</p>
    <p>There is a "Guest" mod with which the user can use the application and interact with it, but the data is not saved in it, that is, if he creates some kind of route or location, they will not be saved.</p>
